# MMM - from scratch

The goal of this project is very simple: I want to build a Marketing Mix model from scratch to understand how it works.

Why this is different to other open source MMMs? Because I'll try to build it just using numpy and pandas for data manipulation. Of course, it will perform worse than the others but the goal is to learn and truly understand how MMM works.
