Marketing Mix Modeling Fundamentals
----------------------------------

Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is built on several key mathematical concepts:

1. **Adstock Transformation**: Models how marketing effects persist over time
2. **Saturation Functions**: Capture diminishing returns on marketing spend
3. **Linear Regression**: Quantifies the relationship between variables
4. **Contribution Analysis**: Decomposes total effects into component parts

Each concept is explained in detail in the sections below.
